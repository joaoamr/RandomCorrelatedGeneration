# RandomCorrelatedGeneration
Generate a group of correlated float pairs based on a Pearson's correlation coefficient.

#Background and Motivation
This program is about a research, in which it was necessary to generate a workload for simulation where there was a pair a of resources
(memory and cpu usage) so that they were correlated one to another.
